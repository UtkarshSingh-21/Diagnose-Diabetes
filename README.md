This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on their medical records. It addresses the growing need for early diagnosis of diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions worldwide.

The methodology includes uploading patient datasets, preprocessing and standardizing the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets. A Logistic Regression model is trained to classify outcomes, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualizations. The project demonstrates how machine learning can provide valuable tools for healthcare diagnostics, enabling early intervention and better patient management.

The model achieved strong performance, illustrating the potential of predictive analytics in healthcare. Future improvements could involve using advanced models and larger datasets for even better accuracy.
